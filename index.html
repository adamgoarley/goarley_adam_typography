  <p id="p2">This is what sets the TRAA apart from other clubs and organizations. You'll find us right in the water
clearing obstructions from streams, measuring returning salmonids & taking scale samples for DNA
analysis, education through trout hatchery tours & stream walks, being a voice for the Thames River
watershed & its inhabitants and the list goes on.
